Transferring data between kernel and userspace:

/proc - exporting/importing from userspace
proc_create_file() to create /proc thing
kernelWrite() reads from the user into kernel
down_write()/up_write() - locks/unlocks variables for writing


File systems:

Logical view - tree structure of files
Physical view - sequence of blocks

Mapping possibilities:
Linked list - each block contains pointer to next - random access costly
Indexed allocation - store pointers in one location (index block - similar to page table) - index block of index blocks when coping with vastly differing file sizes
FAT (File Allocation Table) - from 70s, designed for small disks
FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 - number of bits per FAT entry
Sector = disk unit (e.g. 512 byte), aka block
Cluster = multiple sectors (factor 1, 2, 4, ..., 128)
Uses linked list ("Cluster Chain") to group clusters

FAT16 Filesystem structure:
Boot sector
Other reserved
FAT
Root Directory
