OS provides uniform view of devices/information storage
Mediums such as CD, floppy disk etc. handled by device (access speed etc.)
OS handles mapping files within memory onto secondary storage
Linux: /dev - devices
I/O subsystem responsible for preventing jobs from overlapping
HDD drivers are standardized to prevent data loss, drivers for other devices are more diverse

Protection - controlling access of process or users to OS resources
Security - defense of the system against internal and external attacks

Processes interact by making System Calls to the OS (kernel)
- Program Execution: OS loads a program into memory and runs it, dealing with any errors, and cleaning up after the program has finished running
- I/O Operation
- File-system manipulation: Programs need to read and write to files and directories, OS handles data access and permission management
- Interprocess Communication: Allowing processes to share data through message passing or shared memory
Implementation may change from kernel to kernel, hence standardized System Calls (API) is needed

Internal services (available only to the OS)
- Error Handling: Device failure, program tries to divide by zero or access protected memory
- Resource Allocation: Handling processes competing for CPU, memory and I/O access
- Accounting: How much disk space is a user using, how much network bandwidth etc.
- Protection and Security
