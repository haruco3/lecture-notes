External fragmentation: big holes in memory where processes could fit
Internal fragmentation: small holes - unusable wasted space - caused by programs only a little smaller than hole

Basic process management:
Place in first suitable hole, if none available suspend oldest process and replace with new one

Rotating first fit: start after last assigned part of memory
Best fit: find smallest usable space
Buddy system: free holes administered according to tree structure (powers of 2), splits chunks when neccessary, smallest possible chunk used

Paging:
Assign memory of fixed size (page)
Each process has allocated page table
page table stores addresses of all pages associated with process
Only OS is allowed to access page tables
Hardware checks if page no is valid
