IP

Single network layer over which all transports can run, and can run over all available lower layers
Minimal
You put an address on a packet and the network makes an *attempt* to deliver it somewhere
No checksum covering data (checksum covering header)
Hard to imagine a network layer which offers less

Easy to implement

Proposed in 1974 paper

Notation:
Four decimal numbers separated by dots
4 bytes of 32 bits
e.g. 10010011.10111100.11000000.11111010 / 147.188.192.250 / 93.bc.c0.fa
