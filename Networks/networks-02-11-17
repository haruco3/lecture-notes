MTU and IP Fragmentation

When IP packets are sent, they have a maximum size dictated by the network they are being sent over.
MTU: Maximum Transmission Unit
Ethernet is 1488 (~1500)

Lower Bound: Links must be able to pass more than 576 bytes in order to pass IP.
Payload(512) + IP header(20) + room for IP options (44)

Hard limits:
If you know the device you are talking to is on the same physical network as you, you know the MTU is the network MTU (e.g. if you are both on the same Ethernet, the MTU is ~1500).
This is very conservative, MTU is very small

Fragmentation:
Don't do this.

Path MTU Discovery:
Force DF(Do not fragment) flag on big packet
ICMP Destination Unreachable if fragmentation required but forbidden

IPv6: Minimum packet size 1280
Fragmentation an option instead of core part of protocol


Network layer: communication between hosts
Transport layer: communication between processes
Two main transport services, TCP(Transport Control Protocol)  and UDP(User Datagram Protocol)
TCP offers congestion control, flow control and connection setup
UDP more crude
For both: No delay guarantees, no bandwidth guarantees
