Repeater - amplifier; collisions seen on both sides
Bridge receives, buffers and transmits frames, so collisions are not propagated
Learning/filtering bridges only send frames that belong on the other side
Ether hubs are repeaters, not bridges. There are collisions when two stations talk.

10BaseT is cheaper and more flexible to install than 10Base2, but no faster
100BaseT raises speed, switching made it even faster
1000BaseT (GigE), 10GigE, 40GigE and now 100GigE
Switch - set of learning bridges in a box
Each interface is its own collision domain - only two stations on network
Full Duplex - send and recieve at the same time
Large buffers internally deal with congestion
Result: no collisions but increases latency

Cut-through switch does not wait for whole packet to arrive, just header
Reduces latency but propagates broken packets

Random Early Drop
Naive method - when buffer fills up, drop packets
RED throws some packets away as buffer fills up
Percentage chance of discard increases as free buffer memory decreases

Token Ring/Bus
Pass a "token" from station to station
The station that holds the token can transmit, then passes token on when finished
In theory, offers upper bound for latency. In practice, very hard to get right
- Token loss/creation
- Station failure
FDDI Fibre (100Mbps) - fast and very stable

Slotted Ring - 'slots' circulate around network
If slot is empty, data is inserted
Requires minimum length of network, so there are sufficient number of empty slots

ATM: Asynchronous Transfer Mode
Proposed by Telcos
Breaks data into stream of 48-byte packets
Virtual circuits, so only needs 5-byte header

Echo Cancellation
Brain rejects most echoes (Haas effect)
Echo comes out of telephone speaker and goes into mic
Brain can't reject it
American lines filter echo
France is smaller and does not require this

ATM switches couldn't handle volume of circuit establishment required
Solution is "permanent virtual circuit", goes from house to ISP
