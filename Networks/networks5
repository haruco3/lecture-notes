LANs, MANs & WANs
(Local, Metropolitan and Wide)
Historically WANs have been slow
There were limitations where you could lay cables in Europe (public right of way etc.)
LANs were almost entirely proprietary
WANs - more than a kilometer
Originally networks designed for file transfer, job transfer, and remote login
Efficiency is very important when UK-US link is 2.4kb
Packets need to be as big as possible, otherwise bandwidth is wasted on small data and big header

Packets vs Circuits
Circuit - direct electrical connection

Packet has addressing information
Router looks at incoming packets and decides where to send it
Router complexity scales by number of packets processed
Virtual circuits - scales by number of unique connections as well as number of packets processed

Connectionless / Datagram
No guarantee that packets will arrive
All responsibility for reliability lies with the endpoints

Ethernet
Takes inspiration from radio networks (Hawaii's AlohaNet)
Bus - single cable with computers connected
Max length is 500m, can be amplified to go to 1500m
Simple packet format
7 bytes of preamble (0x55) - clock synchronisation
1 byte start of frame delimiter (0x5d)
6 byte source address(48 bits)
6 byte destination address
CRC - Cyclic redundancy check (GF2)

Checksum - checksum made on the fly, last four bytes are correct checksum
Wait until network is quiet, then send data
Collision detection - listens to ether and checks it only contains signals being sent
Jams network - everyone knows collision is in process
Minimum packet size - 64, otherwise computer would have finished sending data before collision can be detected
Recovery - delay by random number x 512 bit periods
Problems - not stable
On larger networks, if more than 2 computers try to talk simultaneously, recovery is much more difficult
Collisions scale exponentially

Dumb bridge - forwards packets to all other connections
Filtering/learning bridge - learns which side connections are on, both sides can communicate without collision from the other
